## Project Description

This website is a responsive, mobile-first design that utilizes **Bootstrap** for the layout and **SASS** for enhanced styling and organization. The goal of the project is to practice working with CSS preprocessors and front-end frameworks while also building a functional, attractive site.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Markup language used to structure the website.
- **CSS3** - Styling language for the presentation of the website.
- **SASS** - CSS preprocessor that allows the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, etc.
- **Bootstrap** - Front-end framework used for responsive grid layout and UI components.
- **JavaScript** - For basic interactivity (if applicable).

## Features

- Fully responsive design that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- Customizable and modular styles using SASS.
- Bootstrap grid system for responsive layouts.
- Interactive elements (like buttons, modals, and navigation) powered by Bootstrap components.
